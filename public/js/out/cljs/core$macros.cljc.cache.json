Note also\n  that recur calls to the method head should *not* pass the target object, it\n  will be supplied automatically and can not be substituted.\n\n  In the method bodies, the (unqualified) name can be used to name the\n  class (for calls to new, instance? etc).\n\n  The type will have implementations of several ClojureScript\n  protocol generated automatically: IMeta/IWithMeta (metadata support) and\n  IMap, etc.\n\n  In addition, defrecord will define type-and-value-based =,\n  and will define ClojureScript IHash and IEquiv.\n\n  Two constructors will be defined, one taking the designated fields\n  followed by a metadata map (nil for none) and an extension field\n  map (nil for none), and one taking only the fields (using nil for\n  meta and extension fields). Note that the field names __meta\n  and __extmap are currently reserved and should not be used when\n  defining your own records.\n\n  Given (defrecord TypeName ...), two factory functions will be\n  defined: ->TypeName, taking positional parameters for the fields,\n  and map->TypeName, taking a map of keywords to field values."],"^4N",["^ ","^5B",null,"^5C",["^ ","^5D","/Users/sungkwak/Desktop/prop-dev/interp/public/js/out/cljs/core.cljc","^5P",2585,"^5O",16,"^5R",2585,"^5E",26,"^5Q",true,"^5L",["^5K",["^5S",["^5K",[["~$size"],["^6T","^?I"],["^6T","^?I","~$&","~$more-sizes"]]]]],"^5F",["^ ","^5G",true,"^5H",2,"^5I",2,"^5J",["^5K",[["^?I"],["^6T","^?I"]]],"^5L",["^5K",[["^?I"],["^6T","^?I"],["^6T","^?I","~$&","^?J"]]],"^5N",["^5K",[null,null,null]]]],"^4[","~$cljs.core$macros/make-array","^5D","public/js/out/cljs/core.cljc","^5E",26,"^5F",["^ ","^5G",true,"^5H",2,"^5I",2,"^5J",["^5K",[["^?I"],["^6T","^?I"]]],"^5L",["^5K",[["^?I"],["^6T","^?I"],["^6T","^?I","~$&","^?J"]]],"^5N",["^5K",[null,null,null]]],"^5J",["^5K",[["^?I"],["^6T","^?I"]]],"^5V",null,"^5H",2,"^5N",["^5K",[null,null,null]],"^5O",1,"^5G",true,"^5W",[["^ ","^5H",3,"^5G",false,"^5X",["^6",["^5Y","^5Z","^5["]]],["^ ","^5H",4,"^5G",false,"^5X",["^6",["^60","^61"]]],["^ ","^5H",2,"^5G",true,"^5X",["^6",["^5Y","^5Z","^5["]]]],"^5P",2585,"^5Q",true,"^5R",2585,"^5I",2,"^62",false,"^5L",["^5K",[["^?I"],["^6T","^?I"],["^6T","^?I","~$&","^?J"]]]],"^4O",["^ ","^5B",null,"^5C",["^ ","^5D","/Users/sungkwak/Desktop/prop-dev/interp/public/js/out/cljs/core.cljc","^5P",1116,"^5O",31,"^5R",1116,"^5E",51,"^5T",true,"^5Q",true,"^5L",["^5K",["^5S",["^5K",[["~$x"]]]]]],"^4[","~$cljs.core$macros/unchecked-negate-int","^5D","public/js/out/cljs/core.cljc","^5E",51,"^5J",["^5K",[["^66","^67","~$x"]]],"^5V",null,"^5N",["^5K",[null,null]],"^5O",1,"^5G",false,"^5P",1116,"^5Q",true,"^68",["^6",["^60","^61"]],"^5R",1116,"^5I",3,"^62",false,"^5L",["^5K",["^5S",["^5K",[["~$x"]]]]],"^5T",true],"~$simple-test-expr?",["^ ","^5B",null,"^5C",["^ ","^5D","/Users/sungkwak/Desktop/prop-dev/interp/public/js/out/cljs/core.cljc","^5P",862,"^5O",13,"^5R",862,"^5E",30,"^6G",true,"^5L",["^5K",["^5S",["^5K",[["^5:","~$ast"]]]]]],"^6G",true,"^4[","~$cljs.core$macros/simple-test-expr?","^5D","public/js/out/cljs/core.cljc","^5E",30,"^5J",["^5K",[["^5:","^?N"]]],"^5V",null,"^5N",["^5K",[null,null]],"^5O",1,"^5G",false,"^5P",862,"^68","^69","^5R",862,"^5I",2,"^62",true,"^5L",["^5K",["^5S",["^5K",[["^5:","^?N"]]]]]],"^4P",["^ ","^5B",null,"^5C",["^ ","^5D","/Users/sungkwak/Desktop/prop-dev/interp/public/js/out/cljs/core.cljc","^5P",1101,"^5O",31,"^5R",1101,"^5E",44,"^5T",true,"^5Q",true,"^5L",["^5K",["^5S",["^5K",[["~$x"]]]]]],"^4[","~$cljs.core$macros/unchecked-inc","^5D","public/js/out/cljs/core.cljc","^5E",44,"^5J",["^5K",[["^66","^67","~$x"]]],"^5V",null,"^5N",["^5K",[null,null]],"^5O",1,"^5G",false,"^5P",1101,"^5Q",true,"^68",["^6",["^60","^61"]],"^5R",1101,"^5I",3,"^62",false,"^5L",["^5K",["^5S",["^5K",[["~$x"]]]]],"^5T",true],"^4Q",["^ ","^5B",null,"^5C",["^ ","^5D","/Users/sungkwak/Desktop/prop-dev/interp/public/js/out/cljs/core.cljc","^5E",19,"^5F",["^ ","^5G",true,"^5H",1,"^5I",1,"^5J",["^5K",[[],["~$x"]]],"^5L",["^5K",[[],["~$x"],["~$x","~$&","^;G"]]],"^5N",["^5K",[null,null,null]]],"^5O",16,"^5P",867,"^5Q",true,"^5R",867,"^5L",["^5K",["^5S",["^5K",[[],["~$x"],["~$x","~$&","^;G"]]]]],"^64","Evaluates exprs one at a time, from left to right.
